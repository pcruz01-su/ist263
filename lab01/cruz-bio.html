        I am Priscilla Cruz; my major is Information Management and Technology, concentrating on Web Design. I have strong creativity and passion for creating designs for anything from home d√©cor, landscaping, fashion, to websites. I am also a 2nd Lieutenant in the United States Army. Outside of work, I spend most of my time practicing my craft but I also enjoy learning about cars, going to the gym, studying the bible, or painting. My top three favorite TV shows of all time are The Twilight zone, Friends, and The Office.
